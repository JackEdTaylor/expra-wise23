### Schedule

Please see below for our current optimistic schedule. Depending on our progress, potential problems and different forms of learning, content and times might change a bit. Each lecture will be divided into several parts separated by a 5-10 minute break and might constitute a transition from basic to advanced concepts, theoretic to practical sessions and individual to group work. The different parts are roughly indicated in the schedule below like this:



**Please note** that the optimistic schedule below may be subject of change, dependent on time constraints and progress made in the previous meetings.
