Welcome to the course page for Group 5 of the PsyBSc 10 course: Empirisch-Experimentelles Praktikum (*ExPra*), for Winter Semester 2023!

This course forms part of the [Psychologie BSc programme](https://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/49829433/Bachelorstudiengang?) at Goethe University Frankfurt. This site will contains all the content we will cover, and will hopefully serve as a useful reference point for the course. These pages aren't static, but will be updated as we move through the course together.

## ExPra Winter Semester 2023

A lot of the time, when learning about Psychology, we only focus on the end-product of research. Even from a detailed publication, it can be very difficult to understand exactly what happened without experience and understanding in the research process. The focus of the ExPra course is to gain hands-on experience with research in Psychology. Not everyone will go on to work in research settings after their degree, but everyone can benefit from the experience you will gain in this course. First, the course should help you evaluate and conceptualise research methods in research that you encounter in the remainder of your studies. Second, we will aim to help you develop transferable skills such as critical and scientific thinking, project management, and quantitative analyses, that should be valuable whatever yu end up doing after your degree.
